      <h1>Razor Bumps</h1>
      <p><b>Razor bumps</b> are a common issue caused by improper shaving techniques. To avoid them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a <i>sharp razor</i>.</li>
        <li>Apply <u>shaving cream</u> generously.</li>
        <li>Shave in the direction of hair growth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, ensure you properly clean your razor after each use to prevent bacterial buildup. Exfoliate your skin regularly to remove dead skin cells that can clog pores and exacerbate razor bumps. If irritation occurs, apply a soothing aftershave balm to reduce redness and inflammation.</p>
      <p>Remember, taking a little extra care while shaving can save you from discomfort and keep your skin smooth and healthy.</p>
